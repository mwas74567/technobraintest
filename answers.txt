1. One of the ways i would handle error occurence would be logging the errors and displaying and option for setup re-running to see if the installation will be a success.
2.I would capture and store events so as to be able to analyse the cause of the error and later display it to the user for easier checking and troubleshooting for the root of the problem
3.To check the validity of the data i would add a script to set the execution policy to remote signed which checks on the intergrity of data or path from which the script will run from
